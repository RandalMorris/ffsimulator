The goal of ffsimulator is to simulate fantasy football seasons. This helps analyze distributions of:

- expected season finish
- player contribution to wins
- etc?

by simulating 100 fantasy seasons with historical weekly finishes + fantasypros current redraft rankings to determine overall/relative team strengths. 

## Installation

Install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ffsimulator", repos = "https://ffverse.r-universe.dev")

# or use remotes/devtools
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffsimulator", ref = "dev")
```

## Roadmap

- Connect via ffsimulator -`ff_connect` and friends ✅
- Download scoring history - `ff_scoringhistory` ✅
- Calculate the population of player scores for a given adp ranking ✅
- Apply a separate injury model ✅ (- Download latest fantasypros rankings ✅
- Download rosters - `ff_rosters` ✅
- Connect rosters to fantasypros rankings and player score outcomes
- randomly select n games for each player
- calculate optimal lineups (learn lpSolve? seems easy to build out the constraints from ff_starter_positions...)
- calculate started lineups (rnorm around 75+-0.05 of the optimal lineup points?)
- convert week scores into fantasy season schedule (via tony's ffsched package)
- calculate win/loss (H2H  + allplay) + total season points for/potential points
- figure out plots and viz

Main function:

```{r eval = FALSE}

ff_simulate <- function(
  conn, # ff_connect() only (?)
  scoring_history = NULL, # figure out way to memoise this for the conn, or something?
  historical_fantasypros = NULL, # hardcode five years of data? memoise?
  rosters = NULL, # almost unnecessary given that we're starting with a conn
  latest_rankings = NULL, # either null (which triggers a download) OR a dataframe with rankings
  starter_positions = NULL, # memoised?
  n_seasons = 100,
  weeks_per_season = 14, # most common regular season length going forward, probably?
  seed = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE){
  
}

```

## User Flows

Minimal user flow looks like:

```{r eval = FALSE}
conn <- mfl_connect(2021, 54040) # or ff_connect etc for the platform
simulation_results <- ff_simulate(conn)
```

This route helps pick sensible defaults for everything, as best as I can design it.

Reproducible - this route should have the same results every time. More or less.

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- ff_simulate(conn, seed = 613)
```

Basic configs:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- ff_simulate(
  conn = conn,
  seed = 613,
  n_seasons = 100,
  weeks_per_season = 17,
  is_best_ball = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

More customization:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- ff_simulate(
  conn = conn,
  custom_rankings = df_rankings,
  seed = 613,
  n_seasons = 100,
  weeks_per_season = 17,
  is_best_ball = FALSE,
  injury_model = c("simple", "none"),
  owner_efficiency = list(average = 0.75, sd = 0.025),
  verbose = FALSE
)
```

Do everything from scratch:

(lower level function  access)

## Code sketching

```{r eval = FALSE}

# library(ffsimulator)
library(ffscrapr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(arrow)

## CONNECT TO LEAGUE

conn <- mfl_connect(2021, 54040)

## DOWNLOAD SCORING HISTORY

scoring_history <- ff_scoringhistory(conn, 2006:2020)

## CALCULATES SEASON RANKS AND THE POPULATION OF PLAYER SCORES FOR THAT RANK 

pos_rank <- scoring_history %>% 
  group_by(season, gsis_id, mfl_id, player_name, pos, team) %>% 
  summarise(
    games = n(),
    ppg = mean(points, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(
    games > 4
  ) %>% 
  group_by(season, pos) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(desc(ppg),ties.method = "random")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(season, pos, rank) %>% 
  left_join(
    scoring_history %>% select(season, gsis_id, week, points),
    by = c("season", "gsis_id")
  ) %>% 
  group_by(pos, rank) %>% 
  summarise(
    all_points = list(points)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(one_season = map(all_points, sample, size = 1000, replace = TRUE))

# fp_parquet <- tempfile()
# download.file("https://github.com/dynastyprocess/data/raw/master/files/db_fpecr.parquet",fp_parquet)

## DOWNLOADS LATEST FANTASYPROS RANKINGS

fantasypros <- arrow::read_parquet("data-raw/db_fpecr(1).parquet") %>% 
  filter(ecr_type == "ro", scrape_date == max(scrape_date), pos %in% c("QB","RB","WR","TE")) %>% 
  select(player, fantasypros_id = id, pos, team, ecr, sd) %>% 
  group_by(pos) %>% 
  mutate(rank = rank(ecr, ties.method = "random")) %>% 
  ungroup()

## CONNECTS ROSTERS TO FANTASYPROS + PLAYER SCORES 

rosters <- ff_rosters(conn) %>% 
  select(franchise_id, franchise_name, mfl_id = player_id, player_name, pos, team, age) %>% 
  left_join(dp_playerids() %>% select(fantasypros_id, mfl_id),
            by = "mfl_id") %>% 
  left_join(fantasypros %>% select(fantasypros_id, rank),
            by = "fantasypros_id") %>% 
  left_join(pos_rank %>% select(pos,rank,all_points),
            by = c("pos","rank")) %>% 
  mutate(
    season_games = map_if(all_points,!is.na(rank), sample, size = 17, replace = TRUE)
  )

## CALCULATE OPTIMAL LINEUPS

# two paths: a) develop heuristics b) use lpSolve
# ideally solver does the optimisation

starter_positions <- ff_starter_positions(conn)

## LOGIC FOR CALCULATING STARTED LINEUPS

# a) Always choose highest ranked player by fantasypros
# b) Assume random percentage between 70-85% of optimal points

## APPLY WEEK SCORES INTO FANTASY SEASON SCHEDULES

# (use tony's ffsched package)

## CALCULATE WIN/LOSS (H2H, ALL-PLAY) + TOTAL SEASON POINTS FOR/ POTENTIAL POINTS

## figure out plots and visualizations later?
