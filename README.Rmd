The `{ffsimulator}` package helps simulate fantasy football seasons. By leveraging historical weekly finishes, current expert consensus rankings, and your league's data, this package can quickly run your league through hundreds of seasons and may help you study:

-   expected season finishes and range of outcomes
-   player contributions to season wins
-   effects of potential trades
-   and more!

This package is part of the [ffverse](https://ffverse.com) family of R packages for fantasy football analysis.

## Installation

Install the stable version of this package from the [ffverse r-universe repository](https://ffverse.r-universe.dev):

```{r}
install.packages("ffsimulator", repos = "https://ffverse.r-universe.dev")
```

Install the development version with either [DynastyProcess's r-universe](https://dynastyprocess.r-universe.dev) or remotes + GitHub:

```{r}
# ffverse's r-universe
install.packages("ffsimulator", repos = "https://dynastyprocess.r-universe.dev")

# or via GitHub c/o remotes/devtools: # install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("dynastyprocess/ffsimulator")
```

The dev version has a [separate documentation site here](https://ffsimulator.ffverse.com/dev/).

## Roadmap

-   Create logic in ADP outcomes to bin together nearby ranks (nearest one above/below) :white_check_mark: *(binning +1 and -1 together)*
-   Scrape more historical ranks to include in package so that we can use 2010-2020 :white_check_mark: *(2012-2020 is close enough!)*
-   Patch data inconsistency for IDs (2012:2015)
-   Create join functions for each of the remaining ff_connect classes :white_check_mark:
-   Create summary function (season-level H2H wins/winpct, AP wins/winpct, total PF + PP) :white_check_mark:
-   Create simulation summary table :white_check_mark:
-   Write function documentation
-   Write tests
-   Write basic usage vignette
-   Write custom usage vignette
-   Clean up README
-   CRAN prep

## Usage

This package shares many conventions with the ffverse, including all main functions being prefixed with `ff_` for ease of autocomplete.

```{r}
library(ffsimulate)

conn <- mfl_connect(2021,22627)

sims <- ff_simulate(conn, n_seasons = 100, weeks_per_season = 14, best_ball = FALSE)

sims$summary
```

Please also see the [basic usage](https://ffsimulator.ffverse.com/articles/basic.html) and [manual simulation](https://ffsimulator.ffverse.com/articles/manual.html) vignettes for a detailed introduction.
